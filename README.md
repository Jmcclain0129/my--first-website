# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

My Name is John McClain and this is as I have noted my first ever web development project.

My plan for this project is to develop a frontend single page scroller site that describes a SaaS service I plan on developing as my main Code Institue project.

The service is a lead generation model like those commonly discovered online such as boberdoo.com but far less complex. The service will be designed to allow the user to enter in keyword(s) related to products and or services they are in the market for.

You might be thinking this sounds a lot like google or any other search engine and on the surface you would be right to think so. However, this project is not designed to deliver the user hits based on the keywords they are searching. The engine is designed to find the matches and alert them that the systems user is interested in their product or service. This way the user is not having to scan through all of the results google would display to find contact details to reach out to the seller.

In my model, the search engine I am developing will find all relevant sellers related to the product or service the user is searching and notify them that a lead exists. This forces the seller to express an interest in dealing directly with the buyer. What is mainly does is reduces the amount of time a seller has to put into researching products and services they are in need of because the onus is shifted to the buyer to contact the seller ( alead the system has generated for them).
