# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

My Name is John McClain and this is my first ever web development project.

My plan for this project is to develop a frontend single page scroller site that describes a SaaS service I plan on developing as my main Code Institue project.

The SaaS service is a lead generation model like those commonly discovered online such as boberdoo.com but far less complex.

The service will be designed to allow the user to enter in keyword(s) related to products and or services they are in the market for.

You might be thinking this sounds a lot like google or any other search engine for that matter. However, this system targets the sellers associated with the search results and notifies them that a buyer is interested in their product or service.
